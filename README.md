# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To study two different UX project scenarios by identifying user pain points, writing clear UX problem statements, selecting appropriate user research methods, and creating detailed personas. These findings help understand user needs and guide effective, user-centered design decisions.

## Algorithm:

1.Read and analyze the provided scenarios (A & B).

2.Identify personas and their behaviours, goals, and contexts.

3.Extract the specific pain points listed for each persona.

4.Organize the pain points into a structured format for UX evaluation.

5.Present the consolidated pain points in a clean, readable output window.

## Output

# Scenario A – Personal Health-Tracking App

### 1. Pain Points Identified
- App-hopping between multiple health apps  
- Confusing calorie breakdowns  
- Data does not sync properly  
- Overloaded dashboards  
- Red “failure” badges that demotivate users  

---

### 2. UX Problem Statements
**PS-A1:**  
"Busy young professionals need a way to consolidate their fragmented health data in one place because juggling multiple apps is time-consuming and confusing, which results in missed wellness goals."

**PS-A2:**  
"First-time fitness users need simple and clear feedback because overwhelming dashboards cause confusion, leading to app abandonment in the first week."

---

### 3. Research Methods & Rationale
- **In-depth Interviews:** Helps uncover emotional triggers and current coping mechanisms.  
- **Diary Study (2 weeks):** Captures real-world daily friction when switching apps.  
- **Moderated Usability Test:** Validates whether a unified dashboard reduces cognitive load.
